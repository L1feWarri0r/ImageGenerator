## Usage
- Enter a description or prompt.
- Click the "Generate Image" button.
- The app will use the Hugging Face API to generate an image based on your description.
- The generated image will be displayed in the browser.
## Hugging Face API Integration
The image generation is powered by Hugging Faceâ€™s machine learning models. In the app, the description or prompt provided by the user is sent to the Hugging Face API, which processes the input and returns a generated image.

### Key Steps:
- Set up an API request in the backend (Next.js API routes) to Hugging Face.
- Parse the response and display the image on the frontend.
